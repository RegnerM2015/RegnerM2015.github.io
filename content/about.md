# About

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at UNC Chapel Hill. As a bioinformatician, I have engineered large-scale data analysis pipelines in Bash and R utilizing high-performance computing resources to extract novel biological insights from single-cell multi-omic data derived from human tumor specimens. My work in collaboration with multidisciplinary teams of computational scientists, wet lab bench scientists, and surgical oncologists has resulted in three co-authored scientific journal publications and counting. I hope to pursue a career in scientific research where I can leverage big data to provide insights into human health and disease.
