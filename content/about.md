# About

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate co-advised by Drs. Hector Franco and Joel Parker at UNC Chapel Hill. In the [Franco Lab](https://www.thefrancolab.org), I have engineered large-scale data analysis pipelines in Bash and R utilizing high-performance computing resources to extract novel biological insights from single-cell multi-omic data derived from human tumor specimens. My work in collaboration with multidisciplinary teams of computational scientists, wet lab bench scientists, and surgical oncologists has resulted in three co-authored scientific journal publications and counting.
