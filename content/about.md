# About

I am currently a Ph.D. student co-advised by Drs. Hector Franco and Joel Parker at UNC Chapel Hill. In the [Franco Lab](https://www.thefrancolab.org), I am developing and applying statistical approaches to study gene regulation in human cancers by leveraging single-cell genomics data collected from human tumors. I am deeply passionate about cancer genomics, machine learning, and data science reproducibility. 

Outside of lab, I enjoy gaming, golf and spending time with friends and family.
